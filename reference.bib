abstract = {When seismic waves travel through a fluid-saturated porous medium containing a fracture, fluid pressure gradients are induced between the compliant fracture and the stiffer embedding background. The resulting equilibration through fluid pressure diffusion (FPD) produces a frequency dependence of the stiffening effect of the fluid saturating the fracture. As the reflectivity of a fracture is mainly controlled by the stiffness contrast with respect to the background, these frequency-dependent effects are expected to affect the fracture reflectivity. The present work explores the P- and S-wave reflectivity of a fracture modeled as a thin porous layer separating two half-spaces. Assuming planar wave propagation and P-wave incidence, this article analyzes the FPD effects on the reflection coefficients through comparisons with a low-frequency approximation of the underlying poroelastic model and an elastic model based on Gassmann's equations. The results indicate that, while the impact of global flow on fractur...},

abstract = {We develop extended boundary conditions based on the linear slip model that account for the impact of wave-induced fluid pressure diffusion between a fracture and its embedding background on the stiffening effect of the fluid saturating the fracture. We include these poroelastic effects into the linear slip model through complex-valued and frequency-dependent parameters characterizing the mechanical and hydraulic coupling between the two regions. This new set of effective fracture parameters contains generalized normal and tangential compliances, analogous to those defined in the classical formulation of the linear slip model, and an additional parameter related to the coupling between horizontal and vertical deformation of the fracture. Comparisons of the extended and classical linear slip models with a poroelastic thin layer model show that the extended formulation always performs better when modeling the displacement fields induced by an incident P wave as well as the scattering coefficients. We find that the contribution of the additional effective parameter involved in the proposed boundary conditions is significant at low frequencies with respect to the undrained frequency regime of the fracture and large angles of incidence. These extended boundary conditions can be readily incorporated into viscoelastic modeling algorithms simulating the response of a large-scale fluid-saturated fracture or multiple noninteracting fractures of this kind. The proposed model is expected not only to improve the estimation of mechanical characteristics of fractures in corresponding inversion schemes but can also be used for extracting information with regard to other practically important parameters, such as the background permeability.},

@article{Rubino2015a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Society of Exploration Geophysicists. Numerical simulations of seismic wave propagation in fractured media are often performed in the framework of the linear slip theory (LST). Therein, fractures are represented as interfaces and their mechanical properties are characterized through a compliance matrix. This theory has been extended to account for energy dissipation due to viscous friction within fluid-filled fractures by using complex-valued frequency-dependent compliances. This is, however, not fully adequate for fractured porous rocks in which wave-induced fluid flow (WIFF) between fractures and host rock constitutes a predominant seismic attenuation mechanism. In this letter, we develop an approach to incorporate WIFF effects directly into the LST for a 1D system via a complex-valued, frequency-dependent fracture compliance. The methodology is validated for a medium permeated by regularly distributed planar fractures, for which an analytical expression for the complex-valued normal compliance is determined in the framework of quasistatic poroelasticity. There is good agreement between synthetic seismograms generated using the proposed recipe and those obtained from comprehensive, but computationally demanding, poroelastic simulations.},

abstract = {In nature, permeability is enhanced in the damage zone of faults in crystalline rocks, where fracturing occurs on a wide range of scales. Understanding this permeability structure is paramount for predicting crustal fluid flow. We combine quantitative field and laboratory measurements to predict microfracture damage zone permeability in low-porosity granitic rocks as a function of distance from the fault core and displacement. Microfracture controlled matrix permeability exerts an increasingly dominant role on fluid flow with increasing depth. In the field we analysed the scaling relationships of microfracture densities surrounding strike-slip faults developed in granodiorite within the Atacama fault system in northern Chile. Displacements ranging over 5 orders of magnitude (∼0.012–5000m), allow the variation of microfracture damage with increasing distance from faults to be determined empirically as a function of displacement. We reproduce microfracture damage in the laboratory in a suite of triaxial deformation experiments by inducing cyclic damage in initially intact samples while continuously measuring permeability. Combining field and laboratory datasets through the microfracture density allows the permeability profile with distance from the fault to be predicted from fault displacement.},

@article{Engvik2005,
abstract = {Excellent outcrops in Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica, provide unique insight into the mode and extent of fluid infiltration into metamorphic and plutonic rocks in the middle crust. The fluids are liberated from pegmatitic veins and give rise to alteration halos. In the alteration halos, the conspicuous change in colour is correlated with (1) hydration mineral reactions, and (2) high density of microcracks in quartz and feldspar exceeding that observed in the unaltered host rock by an order of magnitude. The field relations indicate that the veins originated as melt-driven hydraulic fractures, sealed by pegmatite and aplite crystallising from volatile-rich melts, with the alteration halo being the wake of the process zone formed at the tip of the propagating fractures. It is proposed that (1) the size of the alteration zone and the width of the vein are correlated, resulting in higher values of both these quantities for cracks propagating at higher velocities and consequently higher crack propagation toughnesses; (2) the damage zone is characterised by a transient state of high permeability which was short-lived due to rapid healing and sealing of microcracks; (3) the infiltration and retrogression of the high-grade rocks can be considered as a quasi-instantaneous process on geologic time scales with a duration of hours to weeks. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Glutenite reservoirs are frequently significantly heterogeneous because of their unique depositional environment. The presence of gravel in this type of formation complicates the growth path of hydraulic fracture (HF). In this study, laboratory fracturing experiments were conducted on six large natural glutenite specimens (300 mm × 300 mm × 300 mm) using a true triaxial hydraulic fracturing system to investigate the growth law of HF in glutenite reservoirs. Before the experiments were performed, the rock properties of the gravel particles and matrix in the glutenite specimens were determined using various apparatuses. The effects of gravel size, horizontal differential stress, fracturing fluid type (or viscosity), and flow rate on the HF growth pattern, fracture width, and injection pressure were examined in detail. Similar to previous studies, four types of HF intersections with gravel particles, namely, termination, penetration, deflection, and attraction, were observed. The HF growth path in the glutenite specimens with large gravel (40 mm–100 mm) is likely branched and tortuous even under high horizontal differential stress. The HF growth path in the glutenite specimens with small gravel (less than 20 mm) is simple, but a process zone with multiple thin fractures may be created. Breakdown pressure may increase significantly when HF initiates from high-strength gravel particles, which are mainly composed of quartz. HF propagation is likely limited within high-strength gravel particles, thereby resulting in narrow fractures and even termination. The use of low-viscosity fluids, such as slickwater, and the low injection rate can further limit HF growth, particularly its width. As a response, high extension pressure builds up during fracturing.},

abstract = {Damage surrounding the core of faults is represented by deformation on a range of scales from microfracturing of the rock matrix to macroscopic fracture networks. The spatial distribution and geometric characterization of damage at various scales can help to predict fault growth processes, subsequent mechanics, bulk hydraulic and seismological properties of a fault zone. Within the excellently exposed Atacama fault system, northern Chile, micro- and macroscale fracture densities and orientation surrounding strike-slip faults with well-constrained displacements ranging over nearly 5 orders of magnitude (∼0.12 m-5000 m) have been analyzed. Faults have been studied that cut granodiorite and have been passively exhumed from 6 to 10 km depth. This allows direct comparison of the damage surrounding faults of different displacements. The faults consist of a fault core and associated damage zone. Macrofractures in the damage zone are predominantly shear fractures orientated at high angles to the faults studied. They have a reasonably well-defined exponential decrease with distance from the fault core. Microfractures are a combination of open, healed, partially healed and fluid inclusion planes (FIPs). FIPs are the earliest set of fractures and show an exponential decrease in fracture density with perpendicular distance from the fault core. Later microfractures do not show a clear relationship of microfracture density with perpendicular distance from the fault core. Damage zone widths defined by the density of FIPs scale with fault displacement but appear to reach a maximum at a few km displacement. One fault, where damage was characterized on both sides of the fault core shows no damage asymmetry. All faults appear to have a critical microfracture density at the fault core/damage zone boundary that is independent of displacement. An empirical relationship for microfracture density distribution with displacement is presented. Preferred FIP orientations have a high angle to the fault close to the fault core and become more diffuse with distance. Models that predict off-fault damage such as a migrating process zone during fault formation, wear from geometrical irregularities and dynamic rupture are all consistent with our data. We conclude it is very difficult to distinguish between them on the basis of field data alone, at least within the limits of this study. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Savage2011,
abstract = {We investigate the development of fracture distributions as a function of displacement to determine whether damage around small and large faults is governed by the same process. Based on our own field work combined with data from the literature, we find that (1) isolated single faults with small displacements have macrofracture densities that decay as r-0.8, where r is distance from the fault plane, (2) mature fault damage zones can be interpreted as a superposition of these r-0.8 decays from secondary fault strands, resulting in an apparently more gradual decay with distance, and (3) a change in apparent decay and fault zone thickness becomes evident in faults that have displaced more than ∼150 m. This last observation is consistent with a stochastic model where strand formation is related to the number of fractures within the damage zone, which in turn is a function of displacement. These three observations together suggest that the apparent break in scaling between small and large faults is due to the nucleation of secondary faults and not a change in process.

abstract = {One major cause of elastic wave attenuation in heterogeneous porous media is wave-induced flow of the pore fluid between heterogeneities of various scales. It is believed that for frequencies below 1 kHz , the most important cause is the wave-induced flow between mesoscopic inhomogeneities, which are large compared with the typical individual pore size but small compared to the wavelength. Various laboratory experiments in some natural porous materials provide evidence for the presence of centimeter-scale mesoscopic heterogeneities. Laboratory and field measurements of seismic attenuation in fluid-saturated rocks provide indications of the role of the wave-induced flow. Signatures of wave-induced flow include the frequency and saturation dependence of P-wave attenuation and its associated velocity dispersion, frequency-dependent shear-wave splitting, and attenuation anisotropy. During the last four decades, numerous models for attenuation and velocity dispersion from wave-induced flow have been developed ...},

abstract = {In fractured rocks, the amplitudes of propagating seismic waves decay due to various mechanisms, such as geometrical spreading, solid friction, displacement of pore fluid relative to the solid frame, and transmission losses due to energy conversion to reflected and transmitted waves at the fracture interfaces. In this work, we characterize the mechanical properties of individual fractures from P wave velocity changes and transmission losses inferred from static full-waveform sonic log data. The methodology is validated using synthetic full-waveform sonic logs and applied to data acquired in a borehole penetrating multiple fractures embedded in a granodioritic rock. To extract the transmission losses from attenuation estimates, we remove the contributions associated with other loss mechanisms. The geometrical spreading correction is inferred from a joint analysis of numerical simulations that emulate the borehole environment and the redundancy of attenuation contributions other than geometrical spreading in multiple acquisitions with different source-receiver spacing configurations. The intrinsic background attenuation is estimated from measurements acquired in the intact zones. In the fractured zones, the variations with respect to the background attenuation are attributed to transmission losses. Once we have estimated the transmission losses associated with a given fracture, we compute the transmission coefficient, which, on the basis of the linear slip theory, can then be related to the mechanical normal compliance of the fracture. Our results indicate that the estimated mechanical normal compliance ranges from 1 × 10−13 to 1 × 10−12 m/Pa, which, for the size of the considered fractures, is consistent with the experimental evidence available.},

The single material parameter of the problem, the diffusivity, is simply related to the bulk and shear moduli and permeability of the skeletal frame and to the viscous and elastic properties of the constitutive media. Since this common theory treats fluid and solid displacements on an equal footing, it is the most general linearized description of the problem; other treatments are special cases. These latter include the rigid frame approximation used in the petroleum industry and the weak frame approximation used by De Gennes to describe the motion of polymer gels.},

abstract = {A theory is developed for the attenuation and dispersion of compressional waves in inhomogeneous fluid-saturated materials. These effects are caused by material inhomogeneity on length scales of the order of centimeters and may be most significant at seismic wave frequencies, i.e., on the order of 100 Hz. The micromechanism involves diffusion of pore fluid between different regions, and is most effective in a partially saturated medium in which liquid can diffuse into regions occupied by gas. The local fluid flow effects can be replaced on the macroscopic scale by an effective viscoelastic medium, and the form of the viscoelastic creep function is illustrated for a compressional wave propagating normal to a layered medium. The wave speeds in the low- and high-frequency limits are associated with conditions of uniform pressure and of uniform “no-flow,” respectively. These correspond to the isothermal and isentropic wave speeds in a disordered thermoelastic medium. {\textcopyright} 1993, Acoustical Society of America. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We analyse compressional wave attenuation in fluid saturated porous material with porous inclusions having different compressibilities and very different spatial scales in comparison with the background. Such a medium exhibits significant attenuation due to wave-induced fluid flow across the interface between inclusion and background. For the representative element containing two layers (one of them representing inclusion), we show that overall wave attenuation is governed by the superposition of two coupled fluid-diffusion processes. Associated with two characteristic spatial scales, we compute two cross-over frequencies that separate three different frequency regimes. At low frequencies inverse quality factor scales with the first power of frequency $\omega$, while at high frequencies the attenuation is proportional to $\omega$-1/2. In the intermediate range of frequencies inverse quality factor scales with $\omega$1/2. These characteristic frequency regimes can be observed in all theoretical models of wave-induced attenuation, but quantitative estimates of their locations have been lacking so far. The potential application of this model is in estimation of the background permeability as well as inclusion scale (thickness) by identifying these frequencies from attenuation measurements. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2006 RAS.},

abstract = {The ultrasonic anisotropic elastic properties of drained, saturated shales were measured as a function of confining pressure. Two shales were characterized in this study: a Jurassic outcrop shale retrieved under the sea in a saturated state and a Kimmeridge Clay shale cut from a North Sea borehole. Both shales were highly anisotropic, both texturally, as revealed by scanning electron microscopy analysis, and elastically, as measured ultrasonically in the laboratory. The strongest anisotropy was seen in the Kimmeridge Clay shale, where up to 38\% compressional wave anisotropy (Thomsen's parameter •) and up to 58% shear wave anisotropy (Thomsen's parameter '7) were observed. In addition, for both shales, • and ff were found to decrease as a function of increasing confining pressure, with the pore pressure drained to atmosphere, while the anellipticity (deviation of the slowness surfaces from ellipses) was found to be positive and decreased as a function of increasing confining pressure. Accompanying these changes in elastic properties was a decrease in porosity with increasing confining pressure, from 10.5 to 8.5% for the Jurassic shale. The decrease in overall anisotropy of the shales with increasing confining pressure was found to be consistent with theoretical modeling of shale properties where the shale anisotropy and anellipticity were predicted to decrease as a function of decreasing fluid-filled porosity.},

@article{Lumley2010,
abstract = { We are about to face a surge in the need for geophysical characterization and monitoring of subsurface reservoirs and aquifers for CO2 sequestration projects. Global energy demand is rising significantly, expected to double over the next 20–30 years, driven by world population increase and the rapid growth of emerging economies. At the current rate of development of alternate energy sources, it is possible that the world may have to rely even more heavily on carbon-based fuels than at present to meet the impending energy demand (Figure 1). With global oil production near its peak or perhaps already in decline, this will place an increased emphasis on coal and LNG (liquid natural gas) in the carbon-based energy mix, and on unconventional hydrocarbon resources like tight gas, coal-bed methane, and heavy-oil tar sands. All of these carbon-based energy sources, especially coal-fired power plants, LNG, and tar-sand operations, will create a growing supply of excess CO2 . Irrespective of whether man-made CO2 emissions are a significant cause of global climate change, or simply well-correlated with global temperature rise, there will be increasing pressure from world governments to reduce the amount of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere, via policy change (e.g., Kyoto, Copenhagen) or via financial measures (e.g., carbon tax, cap and trade). Capturing industrial CO2 at its various sources and injecting it into deep geologic formations for long-term storage (sequestration) appears to be one of the most promising methods to achieve significant reductions in atmospheric CO2 emissions. },

@inproceedings{Chadwick2010,
abstract = {Since its inception in 1996, the CO2 injection operation at Sleipner has been monitored by 3D time-lapse seismic surveys. Striking images of the CO2 plume have been obtained showing a multi-tier feature of high reflectivity. In the medium to longer term, the topmost layer of CO2, accumulating and migrating directly beneath the topseal, is the main determinant of storage site performance. Fortunately it is this topmost layer that can be most accurately characterized, its rate of growth quantified, and CO2 flux arriving at the reservoir top estimated. The latter is mostly controlled by pathway flow through thin intra-reservoir mudstones. This has increased steadily with time, suggesting either that pathway transmissivities are increasing with time and/or the pathways are becoming more numerous. Detailed 3D history-matching of the topmost layer cannot easily match the observed rate of spreading. Isotropic permeabilities result in a stronger radial component than observed and a degree of anisotropic permeability, higher in a north–south direction, is possible. The main contributor to the mismatch, however, is likely to be small but significant uncertainty in the depth conversion. Irrespective of uncertainty, the observed rate of lateral migration seems to require very high permeabilities, and is, moreover, suggestive of a topseal which behaves like a ‘hard' impermeable flow barrier. Detailed studies such as this will provide important constraints on longer term predictive models of plume evolution and storage performance which are key regulatory requirements.},

@article{Chadwick2005,
abstract = {CO2 produced at the Sleipner natural gas field is being injected into the Utsira Sand, a major saline aquifer. Time-lapse seismic data were acquired in 1999 and 2001, with 2.35 and 4.26 million tonnes of CO2 in the reservoir respectively. The CO2 plume is imaged as a number of bright sub-horizontal reflections within the reservoir unit, growing with time, and underlain by a prominent velocity pushdown. No leakage has been detected from the repository reservoir. The reflections are interpreted as tuned responses from thin (<8 m thick) layers of CO2 trapped beneath thin intra-reservoir mudstones and the reservoir caprock. However, these alone are unable to account for the amount of observed pushdown. A two-component 3D saturation model is therefore developed for the 1999 dataset, with high-saturation CO2 forming the layers and a lesser component of low-saturation CO2 between the layers. Saturations are calculated from the observed reflectivity and velocity pushdown and the resulting model contains 85% of the known injected mass of CO2. A 2D synthetic seismic section through the saturation model matches the observed seismic response well and the model is considered to provide an acceptable description of the CO2 distribution. Signal attenuation is more pronounced within the 2001 plume and its effects are likely to become more significant with time, perhaps reducing the efficacy of seismic verification techniques as the plume grows further. Other geophysical methods, such as microgravimetry, may become increasingly useful at this stage.},

@article{Rubino2011,
abstract = { We studied the seismic attenuation and velocity dispersion effects produced by wave-induced fluid flow in weakly consolidated sandstones containing patchy carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) -brine distributions. The analysis also focuses on the velocity pushdown because of the presence of this gas, as well as on the role of the wave-induced fluid flow (mesoscopic) effects on the amplitude variation with angle (AVA) seismic response of thin layers containing CO 2 , such as those found at the Utsira Sand, Sleipner field, offshore Norway. We found that this loss mechanism may play a key role on conventional surface seismic data, suggesting that further data analysis may provide useful information on the characteristics of the fluid distributions in these environments. Numerical experiments let us observe that although mesoscopic effects can be very significant in this kind of media, the seismic response of a given isolated thin layer computed considering such effects is very similar to that of a homogeneous elastic thin layer with a compressional velocity equal to that of the original porous rock averaged in the effective data bandwidth. This suggests that the thin-bed prestack spectral inversion method published by the authors could be used to estimate representative compressional velocities and layer thicknesses in these environments. In effect, results using realistic synthetic prestack seismic data show that isolated CO 2 -bearing thin beds can be characterized in terms of their thicknesses and representative compressional velocities. This information can be qualitatively related to CO 2 saturations and volumes; thus, the prestack spectral inversion method could find application in the monitoring of the evolution of CO 2 plumes at injection sites similar to that at the Sleipner field. },

abstract = {Since the 1980′s, more than 15 geothermal wells have been drilled in the Upper Rhine Graben (URG), representing more than 60 km of drill length. Although some early concepts were related to purely matrix-porosity reservoirs or Hot Dry Rock systems, most projects in the URG are currently exploiting the geothermal resources that are trapped in fracture networks at the base of the sedimentary cover and in the granitic basement. Lessons-learnt from the European EGS reference site at Soultz-sous-For{\^{e}}ts reveal highest natural permeability in the uppermost altered crystalline basement. Here, we present a compilation of related information to examine a more general validity of this hypothesis for the central URG. In this respect, 15 geothermal wells were analyzed concerning their lithologies, temperature distribution with depth, and their hydraulic yields. Among others, permeable fractures in Triassic sediments were observed among others during drilling operations at Soultz-sous-For{\^{e}}ts, Rittershoffen, Cronenbourg (France), Landau, Insheim, Bruchsal and Br{\"{u}}hl (Germany). The geothermal wells at Soultz-sous-For{\^{e}}ts, Rittershoffen (France), Landau and Insheim (Germany) also intersect well-connected fracture networks in the uppermost altered granitic basement. Permeable fractures are intersected to a depth of 5 km at Soultz-sous-For{\^{e}}ts (France) and Basel (Switzerland). The compilation of geologic, hydraulic and thermal data of 15 geothermal wells shows permeability variation among the lithologies with the maximum observed at the top of the hydrothermally altered granite. This higher permeability is likely due to the intense fracture density in the fault core of the fracture zone and the large porous and altered damage zone which allow connection with the reservoir.},

abstract = {In the Longyearbyen CO2 laboratory project, it is planned to inject carbon dioxide into a Triassic–Jurassic fractured sandstone–shale succession (Kapp Toscana Group) at a depth of 700–1000 m below the local settlement. The targeted storage sandstones offer moderate secondary porosity and low permeability (unconventional reservoir), whereas water injection tests evidence good lateral fluid flow facilitated by extensive fracturing. Therefore, a detailed investigation of fracture sets/discontinuities and their characteristics have been undertaken, concentrating on the upper reservoir interval (670–706 m). Datasets include drill cores and well logs, and observations of outcrops, that mainly show fracturing but also some disaggregation deformation bands in the sandstones. The fracture distribution has a lithostratigraphical relationship, and can be subdivided into: (A) massive to laminated shaly intervals, offering abundant lower-angle shear fractures; (B) massive to thin-bedded, heterogeneous, mixed silty–shaly intervals, with a predominance of non-systematic, pervasive bed-confined fractures; and (C) massive to laminated, medium- to thick-bedded, fine- to coarse-grained sandstones with a lower frequency of mostly steep fractures. These domains represent pseudo-geomechanical units characterized by specific fracture sets and fracture intensity, with indicated relationships between the bed thickness and fracture intensity, and with domains separated along bedding interfaces. We discuss the impact of these lithostructural domains on the fluid flow pathways in the heterolithic storage unit.},

abstract = {P-wave amplitudes may be sensitive even to relatively weak anisotrophy of rock mass. Recent results on symmetry-plane P-wave reflection coefficients in azimuthally anisotropic media are extended to observations at arbitrary azimuth, large incident angles, and lower symmetry systems. The approximate P-wave reflection coefficient in transversely isotropic media with a horizontal axis of symmetry (HTI) (typical for a system of parallel vertical cracks embedded in an isotropic matrix) shows that the amplitude versus offset (AVO) gradient varies as a function of the squared cosine of the azimuthal angle. This change can be inverted for the symmetry-plane directions and a combination of the shear-wave splitting parameter $\gamma$ and the anisotrophy coefficient $\delta$(V). The reflection coefficient study is also extended to media of orthorhombic symmetry that are believed to be more realistic models of fractured reservoirs. The study shows the orthorhombic and HTI reflection coefficients are very similar and the azimuthal variation in the orthorhombic P-wave reflection response is a function of the shear-wave splitting parameter $\gamma$ and two anistrophy parametrs describing P-wave anisotrophy for near-vertical propagation in the symmetry planes. The simple relationships between the reflection amplitudes and anistropic coefficients given here can be regarded as helpful rules of thumb in quickly evaluating the importance of anistrophy in a particular play, integrating results of NMO and shear-wave splitting analyses, planning data acquisition, and guiding more advanced numerical amplitude-inversion procedures.},

abstract = {Damage zones show very similar geometries across a wide range of scales and fault types, including strike-slip, normal and thrust faults. We use a geometric classification of damage zones into tip-, wall-, and linking-damage zones, based on their location around faults. These classes can be sub-divided in terms of fault and fracture patterns within the damage zone. A variety of damage zone structures can occur at mode II tips of strike-slip faults, including wing cracks, horsetail fractures, antithetic faults, and synthetic branch faults. Wall damage zones result from the propagation of mode II and mode III fault tips through a rock, or from damage associated with the increase in slip on a fault. Wall damage zone structures include extension fractures, antithetic faults, synthetic faults, and rotated blocks with associated triangular openings. The damage formed at the mode III tips of strike-slip faults (e.g. observed in cliff sections) are classified as wall damage zones, because the damage zone structures are distributed along a fault trace in map view. Mixed-mode tips are likely to show characteristics of both mode II and mode III tips. Linking damage zones are developed at steps between two sub-parallel faults, and the structures developed depend on whether the step is extensional or contractional. Extension fractures and pull-aparts typically develop in extensional steps, whilst solution seams, antithetic faults and synthetic faults commonly develop in contractional steps. Rotated blocks, isolated lenses or strike-slip duplexes may occur in both extensional and contractional steps. Damage zone geometries and structures are strongly controlled by the location around a fault, the slip mode at a fault tip, and by the evolutionary stage of the fault. Although other factors control the nature of damage zones (e.g. lithology, rheology and stress system), the three-dimensional fault geometry and slip mode at each tip must be considered to gain an understanding of damage zones around faults. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Deformation and alteration zones along kimberlite dikes hold clues as to how point-source volcanic vents can localize along sheet-like intrusions. Brittle deformation zones occur in host rock adjacent to kimberlite intrusions of the Swartruggens Kimberlite Dike Swarm, South Africa. Deformation includes local fracturing and brecciation and is associated with relay zones between offset dike segments. Breccia zones indicate dilation and hydraulic fracturing, and some zones along the dikes were affected by chemical corrosion, forming fresh cores surrounded by onion-skin concentric shells of altered rock. The alteration was caused by either exsolved magmatic volatiles moving in advance of the magma through the fracture, or by hydrothermal fluids. Consideration of the time scales needed for chemical corrosion of host rock requires intrusions to stall at depth prior to transport to higher crustal levels. Highly disrupted offsets could be preferred locations for explosive activity and initial vent formation as dikes approach the surface. A kimberlite pipe forms after magma breaks through to the surface; the altered zones are reamed out and fresh cores in spheroidally altered rock are incorporated into the pipe fill along with more angular country-rock material, as observed in layered volcanic breccias in kimberlite pipes at the Venetia Mine, South Africa. This model may have wider implications for the localization of conduits along dikes in other volcanic systems. Dike segmentation provides weak zones where hydrothermal fluids and magmatic volatiles can be preferentially channeled. Chemical corrosion can further weaken these zones, which may then become the locus for initial phreatic and phreatomagmatic explosions, creating shallow vents that can then channel magma to the surface during eruption. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Geological Society of America.},

It consists largely of ignimbrites, epiclastics and rhyolitic lavas and was considered only a minor reservoir rock for oil with fracture permeability. Petrographic and petrophysical data in selected core samples from the Austral Basin were collected to determine the processes controlling the porosity and permeability of these volcanic rocks. The sequence of processes occurring during cooling and in the post-cooling stages can modify, sometimes substantially, their original petrophysic characteristics. The results show that the highest porosity and permeability occur in rocks with quench fractured glasses and in non-welded ignimbrites with gas-pipe structures, followed by autobrecciated rhyolites. Welded ignimbrites, massive glasses and fresh rhyolites have the lowest permeabilities. The new data indicate that tectonic fracturing is not as significant as was considered before and application of these concepts are relevant in the assesment of volcanic reservoir quality. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Volcanic rocks develop primary and secondary porosity and permeability, depending on both their lithology and the sequence of processes involved in their formation. Primary processes (welding, deuteric crystal dissolution, gas release, flow fragmentation, and crystal shattering) may lead to high porosity and permeability, the best example of which is a nonwelded ignimbrite with well-developed gaspipe zones. Secondary processes (different types of alteration), however, tend to decrease primary porosity. However, certain secondary processes, such as dissolution and hydraulic fracturing, may contribute to enhance total porosity and permeability. These conclusions were developed through a systematic review of reservoir quality in volcanic rocks, integrating lithology and process interpretation with petrophysical data. The said information was taken from selected cores of volcanic rocks from the Serie Tob{\'{i}}fera unit in the Austral Basin and the Precuyano unit in the Neuqu{\'{e}}n Basin, Argentina. A clear understanding of both primary and secondary processes may serve to predict the quality of volcanic reservoirs and could be used as a guide for oil and gas exploration and development in many parts of the world.

abstract = {It is observed that the amount of displacement (d) on a fault is proportional to the mapped trace length L. The exact form of the fault scaling relationship, i.e. d = f(L), is still a subject of some disagreement. A number of workers have interpreted data from individual data sets as indicating a linear relationship between d and L. However, these individual data sets have large scatter and a limited range of scale, so their interpretations are not fully conclusive. Other workers have interpreted combinations of different data sets, taken together, and concluded that the d vs L scaling relationship is non-linear. Fault growth models, however, indicate that the scaling relationship should depend on rock properties so correlations using combined data sets may be questionable. This paper presents a synthesis of published data sets on the displacements and lengths of faults. A summary of each data set is given, including: the geologic setting; the mode of faulting (normal/thrust/strike-slip); and the measurement methods used to obtain the displacement and length data. Sources of scatter in the data due to geologic effects and measurement procedures are reviewed. Our preferred interpretation is that the d-L relationship is linear with a possible cross-over phenomenon between small and large faults, but the unambiguous resolution of this question will require some significant improvements in the existing database. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Fault zone structure and permeability data from the Median Tectonic Line (MTL) in Mie Prefecture, Southwest Japan suggest that fault permeability models are currently too simplistic for such large structurally complex fault zones. Ryoke Belt mylonites are cut by mineralised brittle structures up to 300 m North of the MTL that show evidence of fluid circulation. The Sambagawa schist on the south side of the MTL is deformed into foliated quartz/phyllosilicate gouge across a 15-m-wide zone. The complex fault contact area has foliated cataclasite up to 4 m wide, and is cut by a narrow central planar slip zone that probably represents the most recent seismogenic principal displacement zone. Laboratory-determined permeability data show wide variation with fault rock microstructure (e.g. gouge microclast size), controlled by structural position in the fault zone and slip zone intersections. Central slip zone gouges have the lowest permeabilities of all the fault rocks studied. Fault permeability models should take into account asymmetry where widely contrasting protolith lithologies exist and large permeability variations within a complex central fault zone 'core'. Pore pressure evolution during rupture propagation may vary greatly because of this complexity, but thermal pressurisation is feasible above certain pressures if the slip remains within fine-grained gouge. The different deformation behaviours of contrasting protolith lithologies control the fault zone fabrics and hence final permeability structure. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract The spatial heterogeneity along a fracture is a key determinant for fracture-associated mechanical and hydraulic properties of the subsurface. Laboratory experiments have been performed to test the applicability of the nonwelded interface representation to predict the frequency- and angle-dependent elastic response of a single fracture. The observation that nonwelded interface model can represent quite well the frequency- and angle-dependent reflection response of a fracture has led us to develop a new methodology for estimating the spatially heterogeneous fracture compliance from the reflection response along a fracture surface. A data-driven approach based on Marchenko equation coupled with inverse scattering to solve the nonwelded interface boundary condition has been formulated. The approach estimates the elastic wavefield along a fracture accurately, including the multiple reflections. As an extension, it offers the possibility to estimate fracture compliance using the multiple reflections. We illustrate the concept by numerically modeling 2-D SH waves sensing the heterogeneous tangential compliance of a fracture. The stationary phase method is applied to single and double spatial integrals to analyze the effect of source and receiver aperture on the Green's function retrieval. Our results show that the use of multiple reflections allows a better estimation of the heterogeneous fracture compliance than using primary reflections alone, especially for the far offsets on the fracture plane.},

abstract = { ABSTRACTTraditional amplitude variation with offset and azimuth (AVOAz) analysis for fracture characterization extracts fracture properties through analysis of reflection AVOAz to determine anisotropic parameters (e.g., Thomsen's parameters) that are then related to fracture properties. The validity of this method relies on the basic assumption that a fractured unit can be viewed as an equivalent anisotropic medium. As a rule of thumb, this assumption is taken to be valid when the fracture spacing is less than $\lambda$/10. Under the effective medium assumption, diffractions from individual fractures destructively interfere and only specular reflections from boundaries of a fractured layer can be observed in seismic data. The effective medium theory has been widely used in fracture characterization, and its applicability has been validated through many field applications. However, through numerical simulations, we find that diffractions from fracture clusters can significantly distort the AVOAz signatures when a fracture system has irregular spacing even though the average fracture spacing is much smaller than a wavelength (e.g., ≪$\lambda$/10). Contamination by diffractions from irregularly spaced fractures on reflections can substantially bias the fracture properties estimated from AVOAz analysis and may possibly lead to incorrect estimates of fracture properties. Additionally, through Monte Carlo simulations, we find that fracture spacing uncertainty inverted from amplitude variation with offset (AVO) analysis can be up to 10%–20% when fractures are not uniformly distributed, which should be the realistic state of fractures present in the earth. Also, AVOAz and AVO analysis gives more reliable estimates of fracture properties when reflections at the top of the fractured layer are used compared with those from the bottom of the layer. },
